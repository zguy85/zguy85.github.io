  Welcome to Face The Roar. Using this blog, my little corner of the internet, I want to share lessons I have heard and learned from, as I am still learning too, and share that wisdom with you.

A few years ago, I heard a sermon that really stuck out to me.  I started a blog to encourage people, just like I had been encouraged. I stopped with that blog, but I have been led to start again.

In that sermon, the speaker told the congregation about a hunting strategy that a pride of lions used to take down their prey.

The lion went one way and the lionesses went the other way, surrounding the prey. When they were in position, the Lion gave a loud, startling roar! The gazelle or antelope ran the opposite way upon hearing it, right into the ambush that was set up for it.

Why did this lesson stand out to me? While I do love big cats, this is an analogy to life. We get faced with daunting, scary, intimidating situations and sometime we high-tail it the other way. And when we do, sometimes the enemy has a trap set up for us.

That gazelle had no idea that a trap was set for it or that it was already speculated it would run that way. 

When I thought on it, these are the points I came up with: that gazelle had better odds against one lion than the group of lionesses, the lionesses were already waiting for it, and the one lion would not have expected the gazelle to face him.

That intimidating situation in front of you could be the breakthrough you've been praying for, the miracle you've been looking for, or the door you've needed to be opened. You can't just turn and run away because it sounds big and threatening. 

May God continue to bless you. Don't run from those difficult moments. Stand tall and 
FACE THE ROAR.
